# Multiplayer Snake

I'm porting the server from my previous snake-python project from Python 3 to Go, and the frontend to Javascript using HTML5 bindings.

# Setup

Run the command 'go get github.com/gorilla/websocket' to grab the only dependency. Run 'go install' inside of the source directory to install 'snake-mmo' into '$GOPATH/bin'. Then, start the server with 'snake-mmo' (or '$GOPATH/bin/snake-mmo'), and open snake.html in a web browser.
